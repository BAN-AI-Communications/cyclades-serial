tsrdev (1.3.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for setting 1 or 2 stop bits in libtsrdev.so.

  * Added support for changing RTS/CTS and XON/XOFF settings, although the Linux
    stty program doesn't like the way I do it and gives an error the first
    time RTS/CTS settings are changes - have to look at the stty source.

  * Removed the "-t" option from tsrsock as it's dead code.

  * Changed the "-s" option for tsrsock to mean Socket Server mode, so the
    absense of this option means RFC2217 mode.

  * Made the options for baseport work in an order-independent fashion, the
    first priority goes to the -b option, then to the default for the protocol
    in use.

  * Added a "-f" option to tsrsock to specify running in the foreground, this
    can be used if running from init, and can be used by programmers when
    tracing tsrsock.

tsrdev (1.3.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for AIX, SCO, and Unixware to the code tree.

  * Removed HP-UX man pages.

  * Added a patch to sock.c for when Solaris headers don't define INADDR_NONE.

  * In telnet.c made handle_com_port_command() only take one parameter as the
    second is ignored anyway.

  * Fixed many compiler warnings.
