Solaris doesn't seem to like my grantpt() call and returns -1.  I've made
it flag a warning on this, but we need to debug the code.

Solaris stty does not work, have to get it working, this means taking over
the ioctl() entry point in libc.  Also kermit does not work on Solaris for
unknown reasons.
